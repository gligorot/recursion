First time I failed with a project... feels bad tbh

Merge sort is the working (copied from other guys tho), merge-sort-my-ver is where i got to (without a separate merge method)

Notes to self:
-don't work after a video (Harvard CS50 lecture with the if >return, else>mergesort)
-make a second method if you need to...(merge on top of mergesort)
